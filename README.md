# 1-bit-stack-implementation

This project consisnt of 2 parts. 
In the first part i will describe how i implemented my 1-bit stack design using an electric circuit i build via logisim program.
In the seconde part i will analyze the gtkwave data that where based on my verilog code and verilog test bench i'v written.
Also i will upload all of my verilog code and verilog test bench, All of these files are well explained via comments.

# logical part and electric circuit design
My 1-bit stack implementation uses the basic stack functions which is push and pop. 
In this drawing you can easly visualized stack module process
